### 1. Consumer Payments

#### 1.1. Promissory Notes: Enforcement by Holder in Due Course

##### 1.1.1 Uniform Commercial Code

###### UCC 3-305: Defenses & Claims in Recoupment

> (a) Except as stated in subsection (b), the right to enforce the obligation of a party to pay an instrument is subject to the following:
> 
> (1) a defense of the obligor based on (i) infancy of the obligor to the extent it is a defense to a simple contract, (ii) duress, lack of legal capacity, or illegality of the transaction which, under other law, nullifies the obligation of the obligor, (iii) fraud that induced the obligor to sign the instrument with neither knowledge nor reasonable opportunity to learn of its character or its essential terms, or (iv) discharge of the obligor in insolvency proceedings; 
> 
> (2) a defense of the obligor stated in another section of this Article or a defense of the obligor that would be available if the person entitled to enforce the instrument were enforcing a right to payment under a simple contract; and 
> 
> (3) a claim in recoupment of the obligor against the original payee of the instrument if the claim arose from the transaction that gave rise to the instrument; but the claim of the obligor may be asserted against a transferee of the instrument only to reduce the amount owing on the instrument at the time the action is brought.
> 
> (b) The right of a holder in due course to enforce the obligation of a party to pay the instrument is subject to defenses of the obligor stated in subsection (a)(1), but is not subject to defenses of the obligor stated in subsection (a)(2) or claims in recoupment stated in subsection (a)(3) against a person other than the holder.

###### UCC 3-306: Claims to a Settlement

> A person taking an instrument, other than a person having rights of a holder in due course, is subject to a claim of a property or possessory right in the instrument or its proceeds, including a claim to rescind a negotiation and to recover the instrument or its proceeds. A person having rights of a holder in due course takes free of the claim to the instrument.

###### UCC 9-206: Agreement Not to Assert Defenses Against Assignee; Modification of Sales Warranties Where Security Agreement Exists.

> (1) Subject to any statute or decision which establishes a different rule for buyers or lessees of consumer goods, an agreement by a buyer or lessee that he will not assert against an assignee any claim or defense which he may have against the seller or lessor is enforceable by an assignee who takes his assignment for value, in good faith and without notice of a claim or defense, except as to defenses of a type which may be asserted against a holder in due course of a negotiable instrument under the Article on Commercial Paper (Article 3). A buyer who as part of one transaction signs both a negotiable instrument and a security agreement makes such an agreement.
> 
(2) When a seller retains a purchase money security interest in goods the Article on Sales (Article 2) governs the sale and any disclaimer, limitation or modification of the seller's warranties.

##### 1.1.2 FTC Regulations: 16 CFR 

###### 433.1: Defnitions

> (c) Creditor. A person who, in the ordinary course of business, lends purchase money or finances the sale of goods or services to consumers on a deferred payment basis; Provided, such person is not acting, for the purposes of a particular transaction, in the capacity of a credit card issuer.
> 
> (d) Purchase money loan. A cash advance which is received by a consumer in return for a "Finance Charge" within the meaning of the Truth in Lending Act and Regulation Z, which is applied, in whole or substantial part, to a purchase of goods or services from a seller who (1) refers consumers to the creditor or (2) is affiliated with the creditor by common control, contract, or business arrangement.
> 
> (g) Business arrangement. Any understanding, procedure, course of dealing, or arrangement, formal or informal, between a creditor and a seller, in connection with the sale of goods or services to consumers or the financing thereof.

###### 433.2: Preservation of Consumers' Claims and Defenses

> In connection with any sale or lease of goods or services to consumers, in or affecting commerce as "commerce" is defined in the Federal Trade Commission Act, it is an unfair or deceptive act or practice within the meaning of section 5 of that Act for a seller, directly or indirectly, to:
> 
> (a) Take or receive a consumer credit contract which fails to contain the following provision in at least ten point, bold face, type:
> 
> NOTICE
> 
> ANY HOLDER OF THIS CONSUMER CREDIT CONTRACT IS SUBJECT TO ALL CLAIMS AND DEFENSES WHICH THE DEBTOR COULD ASSERT AGAINST THE SELLER OF GOODS OR SERVICES OBTAINED PURSUANT HERETO OR WITH THE PROCEEDS HEREOF. RECOVERY HEREUNDER BY THE DEBTOR SHALL NOT EXCEED AMOUNTS PAID BY THE DEBTOR HEREUNDER.
> 
> or,
> 
> (b) Accept, as full or partial payment for such sale or lease, the proceeds of any purchase money loan (as purchase money loan is defined herein), unless any consumer credit contract made in connection with such purchase money loan contains the following provision in at least ten point, bold face, type:
> 
> NOTICE
> 
> ANY HOLDER OF THIS CONSUMER CREDIT CONTRACT IS SUBJECT TO ALL CLAIMS AND DEFENSES WHICH THE DEBTOR COULD ASSERT AGAINST THE SELLER OF GOODS OR SERVICES OBTAINED WITH THE PROCEEDS HEREOF. RECOVERY HEREUNDER BY THE DEBTOR SHALL NOT EXCEED AMOUNTS PAID BY THE DEBTOR HEREUNDER.

##### 1.1.4 Jarmillo v. Gonzalez (NM 2002)
- Facts & Procedural history:
	- Defendant bank held lien on plaintiffs' mobile home
	- Plaintiffs sought to revoke acceptance after experiencing water damage from defective pipes
	- Plaintiffs asserted that bank, as assignee, was subject to all claims and defenses that could have been asserted against the seller
	- Bank continued collection efforts and reported delinquent account to credit agencies
	- Trial court granted revocation and damages
- Bank's argument
	- FTC holder in due course rule (433.2) applies only if there is a total failure of performance
		- Relied on FTC's "Statement of Basis and Purpose" published with the rule
		- Statement distinguishes between buyer's defenses against credtor's suit, and buyer's affirmative action against creditor for return of monies paid on account
		- "The latter alternative will only be available where a seller's breach is so substantial that a court is persuaded that rescission and restitution are justified."
- Holding
	- "Holder Rule does not limit affirmative claims to those instances wehre rescission would be appropriate"
- Analysis
	- Three bases for rejecting bank's argument
		- Commentary is not a rule
		- Rule itself is unambiguous
		- Requires inclusion of notice
	- Nothing in text of rule limits buyer's affirmative claims against creditor
		- "[P]urpose of rule is to shift liability for seller misconduct from the consumer to the seller and assignee"
		- Limiting buyer's claims against creditor would frustrate that purpose
		- N.B. Courts are split on this issue
	- UDAP claim
		- Bank's refusal to acknowledge liability under FTC Holder Rule "was tantamount to an incorrect and misleading assertion that no claims could be brought against it"


#### 1.2. Unauthorized Charges on Credit Cards

##### 1.2.1 State Law: Agency

###### Steiger v. Chevy Chase Sav. Bank (DC Ct. App. 1995)

- Facts & Procedural History
	- Cardholder gave his card to third party to use for car rental and hotel during a business trip
		- Holder wrote to rental agency and hotel authorizing use of card
	- User made other charges not specifically authorized
		- User signed holder's name on back of card, and signed charges the same way
	- Holder sued user and obtained judgment for unauthorized charges, but was only able to collect a portion
		- Holder demanded that issuer dismiss the remainder of the charges as unauthorized
- Issue
	- User's "apparent authority" to use card
		- Note that TILA's $50 limit on liability for unauthorized third-party charges does not apply where user has "actual, implied or apparent authority". 15 USC 1602(o)
- Holding
	- User had apparent authority, where cardholder voluntarily relinquised card to user, and where user's signature matched signature on the card
- Analysis
	- Purpose of TILA provisions on unauthorized charges
		- Protect cardholders from liability for unauthorized use
	- TILA incorporates agency principles to define "authorized use"
		- Where cardholder voluntarily relinquishes possession of card (absent fraud, duress, etc.), user has apparent authority and holder is responsible for all charges, even if holder instructed user to limit charges
		- Where holder notifies issuer of unauthorized use, holder is not liabile for subsequent third party charges
		- Voluntary reliquenshment, coupled with matching signature, is enough to create apparent authority, where neither merchant nor issuer is on notice of unauthorized use
	- So, for two charges where user signed her own name instead of the holder's name (as user had signed it on back of card), it was unreasonable for merchant to presume use was authorized
- Questions
	- Why limit holder's liability for unauthorized charges?
	- Who is the least cost avoider here?

###### Azur v. Chase Bank (3d Cir 2010)

- Affirming summary judgment in favor of bank where plaintiff vested user with apparent authority to use card
- Regulation Z, 226.2(a)(8)
> Cardholder means a natural person to whom a credit card is issued for consumer credit purposes, or a natural person who has agreed with the card issuer to pay consumer credit obligations arising from the issuance of a credit card to another natural person. For purposes of 226.12(a) and (b), the term includes any person to whom a credit card is issued for any purpose, including business, commercial or agricultural use, or a person who has agreed with the card issuer to pay obligations arising from the issuance of such a credit card to another person.

###### Discover Bank v. Owens (Cleveland Munic. Ct. 2004)

- Facts:
	- Credit card issuer sought to collect unpaid balance of $5564.28
		- Balance included late fees totaling $1160 over six-year period
		- Balance also included charge for credit protection service, which "evidently did not apply to her credit predicament"
	- Debtor had already paid more than twice the principal amount she had charged
- Analysis:
	- Issuer is responsible for continuing to extend credit long after it should have been clear that debtor would not be able to pay
	- Court exercises "broad equitable powers"  to provide a remedy for debtor in light of issuer's "unreasonable, unconscionable, and unjust business practices"
		- Failure to mitigate damages
		- Unjust enrichment if issuer is allowed to collect greater sum under these circumstances
		- Unconscionability

##### 1.2.2 Federal Law: Regulation Z

###### Hyland v. First USA Bank (ED Pa. 1995)

- Facts
	- While on vacation in Greece, Plaintiffs bought a carpet and paid with their Visa card.
		- Plaintiffs alleged that seller made express warranties as to origin and quality of carpet
		- These turned out to be false
	- Plaintiffs contacted bank and seller to demand a credit
		- Following bank's instructions, plaintiffs returned carpet to seller
		- Greek customs intercepted carpet and said a customs fee applied
		- Plaintiffs refused to pay customs fee, and notifed bank they would hold bank responsible for loss
		- Bank ultimately said its buyer protection did not apply to purchases outside the US, and refused to accept liability
	- Breach of Warranty claim
		- Plaintiffs asserted breach of warranty claim against bank, based on Reg. Z 226.12(c)
		- Defendant asserted it was not liable, because sale took place outside plaintiffs' home state and more than 100 miles of their home. TILA 15 USC 1666i(a)(3)
		- But plaintiffs countered that bank waived that limitation, by initially agreeing to assist them in the dispute
- Holding
	- Plaintiffs adequately alleged a waiver, sufficient to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss
- Analysis
	- Promissory Estoppel
		- Elements
			- Promise by defendant
			- Defendant should reasonably have expected that plaintiff would act in reliance on the promise
			- Actual reliance by plaintiff
			- Enforcement of promise is the only way to avoid injustice
		- Plaintiffs alleged that bank promise to assist them in dispute with seller, and that they acted in reliance on that promise
	- Negligent Misrepresentation
		- Elements
			- Misrepresentation of material fact
			- Defendant knew or shiould have known it was false
			- Defendant intended to induce action by plaintiff
		- Plaintiff acted in justificable reliance on defendant's representation, and was injured as a result

- Claim against card issuer for refund where seller files for bankruptcy before goods/services are provided
	- Reg. Z, 226.12(c)

### 3. Truth in Lending Act

#### 3.1. Precurser: State Anti-Usury Laws

##### 3.1.1. Scope & Issues
- Maximum permissible interest rate
	- Problem of calculating interest rate
		- Distinguishing interest from other charges
- Applicability
	- Consumer loans
	- Often excludes commercial loans and loans to corporations

##### 3.1.2. Antonelli v. Neuman (Fla. 1988)
- Claim under Florida usury statute requires proof of "a corrupt intent to take more than the legal rate for the money loaned"
	- Requisite intent may be shown through evidence that lender knowingly charged or received excessive interest
	- Does not require specific intent to commit usury
	- Accord, Venture Mortgage Fund, L.P. (2d Cir. 2002) (applying NY usury statute)
- Defining "interest"
	- Court looks to subtantance of the transaction
	- May not evade statute by characterizing interest as some other type of charge or fee

##### 3.1.3. In re Venture Mortgage Fund, L.P. (2d Cir. 2002)
- Facts & Procedural History
	- Bankruptcy court disallowed claim against bankrupt estate, based on NY usury statute
	- Claimant was investor in ponzi scheme operated by debtor in bankruptcy
- Issue
	- Whether NY usury statute precluded claim where claimant was victim of debtor's fraud
- Analysis
	- Usury statute makes usurious transaction void (not voidable)
		- No defense or exception for lender who enters into transaction based on borrower's fraud
		- Borrower may be estopped from asserting usury defense to claim by lender, where borrower induced lender's reliance through a special (e.g. fiduciary) relationship with the lender
	- Lender argued that borrower was estopped, because he was an attorney with whom lender had previously consulted on an unrelated matter
		- But there was no attorney-client relationship in the transaction at issue, so no estoppel

#### 3.2. TILA Disclosures

##### 3.2.1. Sources of Authority
- Statute
	- 15 USC 1601 et seq.
- Regulation Z
	- 12 CFR Part 226
- Staff Commentary
	- 12 CFR Part 226, supp. I

##### 3.2.2. Scope
- Applies to extension of "consumer credit" by a "creditor"
- "credit" [226.2(a)(14)]
	- "right to defer payment of debt or to incur dept and defer its payment"
- "consumer credit" [226.2(a)(12)]
	- "credit offered or extended to a consumer primarily for personal, family, or household purposes"
- "creditor" [226.2(a)(17)]
	- anyone who "regularly extends consumer credit that is subject to a finance charge or is payable by written agreement in more than four installments"
- "regularly extends credit"
	- More than 25 times in the preceding calendar year, or
	- More than 5 times, for transactions secured by a dwelling

##### 3.2.3. Mourning v. Family Publications Service (US 1973)
- Upholding "Four Installment Rule" under Reg. Z as "reasonably related to the purpose of the enabling legislation"
	- Rule required TILA disclosures where credit is repayable in more than four installments, regardless of whether a finance charge applies
	- Statute only required disclosures where a finance charge applies
		- N.B. Statute was later amended to conform to Reg. Z
- FDIC could impose broader rule, as means of deterring creditors from evading disclosure requirements by "burying" the cost of credit in the purchase price

##### 3.2.4. Adiel v. Chase Federal Savings & Loan Assn. (11th Cir. 1987)
- TILA disclosure requirements apply where creditor makes loan to a commercial entity, knowing that the loan will be assumed by a consumer with no change in the terms
- Application of TILA is based on the "commercial reality" of the transaction
- Don't allow evasion through careful structuring of the transaction

#### 3.3. Finance Charges and APR

##### 3.3.1. First Acadiana Bank v. FDIC (5th Cir. 1987)
- Where bank requires borrowers to employ a bank-approved lawyer to prepare a chattel mortgage on goods purchased with loan, legal fees are part of the "finance charge" within the meaning of TILA sec. 1605
- Must be disclosed in the "Finance Charge" line on TILA disclosure form
- Requirement is not satisfied by including the charge in the "Amount Financed" category

##### 3.3.2. Gibson v. Bob Watson Chevrolet-Geo, Inc. (7th Cir. 1997)
- Facts
	- Plaintiffs bought car on credit from defendant
	- Transaction included an $800 charge for an extended warranty, to be provided by third-party
	- Car dealer listed $800 under "Amounts Paid to Others on Your Behalf"
	- Dealer actually retained part of the $800, but did not disclose this on the TILA form

##### 3.3.3. Bright v. Ball Memorial Hospital Assn. (7th Cir. 1980)
- Bona fide "late payment" fees charged on delinquent accounts are not "finance charges" under TILA

#### 3.4. Open-End Transactions

##### 3.4.1. "Open-end credit" 
- Sec. 226.2(a)(20)
	- "consumer credit extended by a creditor under a plan in which:
		- The creditor reasonably contemplates repeated transactions;
		- The creditor may impose a finance charge from time to time on an outstanding unpaid balance; and
		- The amount of credit that may be extended to the consumer during the term of the plan ... is generally made available to the extent that any outstanding balance is repaid. 

#### 3.5. Closed-End Transactions
