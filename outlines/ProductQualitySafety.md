Consumer Protection
===================

Product Quality & Safety
---------------------------

### 1 Tort Liability for Unsafe Products

#### 1.1 Restatement (2d) of Torts § 402A

##### 1.1.1 Elements
- Defendant
	- “One who sells any product”
    - “engaged in the business of selling such a product”
        - Cf. “Merchant” under UCC
- Stream of commerce
    - Product “is expected to and does reach the user or consumer without substantial change in the condition in which it is sold”
- Defect
    - “defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer or to his property”
        - Manufacturing defect
        - Design defect
        - Warning defect
- Injury
    - “physical harm … caused to the ultimate user or consumer, or to his property”
- Strict Liability 
    - Not a defense that “the seller has exercised all possible care in the preparation and sale of his product”
- Privity
    - Not a defense that “the user or consumer has not bought the product from or entered into any contractual relation with the seller”

##### 1.1.2 Leichtamer v. American Motors (Ohio 1982)
- Facts:
    - Plaintiffs injured while riding as passenger in a Jeep 
    - Vehicle rolled over while being driven on a steep hill
    - Vehicle had a roll bar, which was displaced in the accident
    - Plaintiffs alleged that the displacement of the roll bar exacerbated their injuries
- Defendants
    - Jeep Corp.: Designed & manufactured the vehicle
    - American Motors: Parent corporation 
    - American Motors Sales: Selling agent
- Claims:
    - Design Defect
		- Design of roll bar was defective, because it didn’t provide protection from this type of roll-over
		- Jeep didn’t test roll bar in this type of roll-over
		- Advertisement of vehicle induced drivers to operate it in a way that made this type of roll-over more likely
		- Roll-bar led consumers to believe it would offer protection in this type of roll-over
	- Failure to warn
- Issue
	- Does strict liability under § 402A apply to design defect?
	- Or is liability for design defect based on negligence (i.e. failure to exercise reasonable care in design)?
- Holding
	- Strict liability applies to design defect
		- Distinguishing between manufacturing and design defects “would only provoke needless questions”
	- Policy: “place liability on the party primarily responsible for the injury, that is, the manufacturer”
		- Public interest favors giving manufacturers an incentive to design their products to be safe
	- Unreasonably dangerous
		- What does “unreasonably dangerous” mean?
			- “Consumer expectation” standard
			- “dangerous to an extent beyond the expectations of an ordinary consumer when used in an intended or reasonably forseeable manner”
			- Product advertising as evidence of consumer expectations
	- Warning Defect
		- Failure to warn does not itself give rise to liability
		- Adequate warning as affirmative defense
			- Because it defeats a consumer expectation that it is safe to use the product in the manner warned against
			- Defense applies where product would be safe to use if the warning is followed
	- Punitive Damages
		- May be awarded where defendant’s conduct involved fraud, malice, or insult
		- Malice may be established by the defendant’s intentional, reckless, wanton, willful, and gross acts 
		- Inadequate product testing as basis for punitive damages
		- “flagrant indifference to the possibility that the product might expose consumers to unreasonable risks of harm”

### 2 Warranties Under UCC Article 2

#### 2.1 Express Warranties

##### 2.1.1 Creation: UCC § 2-213

> § 2-313 Express Warranties by Affirmation, Promise, Description, Sample.
> 
> (1) Express warranties by the seller are created as follows:
> 
> (a) Any affirmation of fact or promise made by the seller to the buyer which relates to the goods and becomes part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the goods shall conform to the affirmation or promise.
> 
> (b) Any description of the goods which is made part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the goods shall conform to the description.
> 
> (c) Any sample or model which is made part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the whole of the goods shall conform to the sample or model.
> 
> (2) It is not necessary to the creation of an express warranty that the seller use formal words such as “warrant” or “guarantee” or that he have a specific intention to make a warranty, but an affirmation merely of the value of the goods or a statement purporting to be merely the seller’s opinion or commendation of the goods does not create a warranty.


- An express warranty may not be disclaimed in the sales contract
    - Because that would enable unfairness, similar to fraud in the inducement
- But contract may clarify or limit terms (see  UCC § 2-316)
    - Magnuson-Moss imposes requirements for express warranties in written consumer product sales contracts 

##### 2.1.2 Exclusion or Modification: UCC § 2-316

> § 2-316. Exclusion or Modification of Warranties.
> 
> (1) Words or conduct relevant to the creation of an express warranty and words or conduct tending to negate or limit warranty shall be construed wherever reasonable as consistent with each other; but subject to the provisions of this Article on parol or extrinsic evidence (Section 2-202) negation or limitation is inoperative to the extent that such construction is unreasonable.
> 
> (2) Subject to subsection (3), to exclude or modify the implied warranty of merchantability or any part of it the language must mention merchantability and in case of a writing must be conspicuous, and to exclude or modify any implied warranty of fitness the exclusion must be by a writing and conspicuous. Language to exclude all implied warranties of fitness is sufficient if it states, for example, that “There are no warranties which extend beyond the description on the face hereof.”
> 
> (3) Notwithstanding subsection (2)
> 
> (a) unless the circumstances indicate otherwise, all implied warranties are excluded by expressions like “as is”, “with all faults” or other language which in common understanding calls the buyer’s attention to the exclusion of warranties and makes plain that there is no implied warranty; and
> 
> (b) when the buyer before entering into the contract has examined the goods or the sample or model as fully as he desired or has refused to examine the goods there is no implied warranty with regard to defects which an examination ought in the circumstances to have revealed to him; and
> 
> (c) an implied warranty can also be excluded or modified by course of dealing or course of performance or usage of trade.
> 
> (4) Remedies for breach of warranty can be limited in accordance with the provisions of this Article on liquidation or limitation of damages and on contractual modification of remedy (Sections 2-718 and 2-719).

##### 2.1.3 Parol Evidence: UCC § 2-202 

§ 2-202 Final Written Expression: Parol or Extrinsic Evidence.

Terms with respect to which the confirmatory memoranda of the parties agree or which are otherwise set forth in a writing intended by the parties as a final expression of their agreement with respect to such terms as are included therein may not be contradicted by evidence of any prior agreement or of a contemporaneous oral agreement but may be explained or supplemented

(a) by course of dealing or usage of trade (Section 1-205) or by course of performance (Section 2-208); and

(b) by evidence of consistent additional terms unless the court finds the writing to have been intended also as a complete and exclusive statement of the terms of the agreement .

##### 2.1.4 Unconscionability: UCC § 2-302 

§ 2-302 Unconscionable contract or Clause.

(1) If the court as a matter of law finds the contract or any clause of the contract to have been unconscionable at the time it was made the court may refuse to enforce the contract, or it may enforce the remainder of the contract without the unconscionable clause, or it may so limit the application of any unconscionable clause as to avoid any unconscionable result.

(2) When it is claimed or appears to the court that the contract or any clause thereof may be unconscionable the parties shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to present evidence as to its commercial setting, purpose and effect to aid the court in making the determination.

#### 2.2 Implied Warranties

##### 2.2.1 Merchantability: UCC § 2-314

> § 2-314 Implied Warranty: Merchantability; Usage of Trade.
> 
> (1) Unless excluded or modified (Section 2-316), a warranty that the goods shall be merchantable is implied in a contract for their sale if the seller is a merchant with respect to goods of that kind. Under this section the serving for value of food or drink to be consumed either on the premises or elsewhere is a sale.
> 
> (2) Goods to be merchantable must be at least such as
> 
> (a) pass without objection in the trade under the contract description; and
> 
> (b) in the case of fungible goods, are of fair average quality within the description; and
> 
> (c) are fit for the ordinary purposes for which such goods are used; and
> 
> (d) run, within the variations permitted by the agreement, of even kind, quality and quantity within each unit and among all units involved; and
> 
> (e) are adequately contained, packaged, and labeled as the agreement may require; and
> 
> (f) conform to the promise or affirmations of fact made on the container or label if any.
> 
> (3) Unless excluded or modified (Section 2-316) other implied warranties may arise from course of dealing or usage of trade.

##### 2.2.2 Fitness for Particular use: UCC § 2-315

> § 2-315. Implied Warranty: Fitness for Particular Purpose.
> 
> Where the seller at the time of contracting has reason to know any particular purpose for which the goods are required and that the buyer is relying on the seller’s skill or judgment to select or furnish suitable goods, there is unless excluded or modified under the next section an implied warranty that the goods shall be fit for such purpose.

#### 2.3 Remedies for Breach of Warranty

##### 2.3.1 Buyer’s Choice of Remedy: UCC § 2-601

> § 2-601 Buyer's Rights on Improper Delivery.
> 
> Subject to the provisions of this Article on breach in installment contracts (Section 2-612) and unless otherwise agreed under the sections on contractual limitations of remedy (Sections 2-718 and 2-719), if the goods or the tender of delivery fail in any respect to conform to the contract, the buyer may
> 
> (a) reject the whole; or
> 
> (b) accept the whole; or
> 
> (c) accept any commercial unit or units and reject the rest.

##### 2.3.2 Acceptance: UCC § 2-714

> § 2-714 Buyer's Damages for Breach in Regard to Accepted Goods.
> 
> (1) Where the buyer has accepted goods and given notification (subsection (3) of Section 2-607) he may recover as damages for any non-conformity of tender the loss resulting in the ordinary course of events from the seller's breach as determined in any manner which is reasonable.
> 
> (2) The measure of damages for breach of warranty is the difference at the time and place of acceptance between the value of the goods accepted and the value they would have had if they had been as warranted, unless special circumstances show proximate damages of a different amount.
> 
> (3) In a proper case any incidental and consequential damages under the next section may also be recovered.

##### 2.3.3 Revocation of Acceptance: UCC § 2-608

> § 2-608. Revocation of Acceptance in Whole or in Part.
> 
> (1) The buyer may revoke his acceptance of a lot or commercial unit whose non-conformity substantially impairs its value to him if he has accepted it
> 
> (a) on the reasonable assumption that its non-conformity would be cured and it has not been seasonably cured; or
> 
> (b) without discovery of such non-conformity if his acceptance was reasonably induced either by the difficulty of discovery before acceptance or by the seller's assurances.
> 
> (2) Revocation of acceptance must occur within a reasonable time after the buyer discovers or should have discovered the ground for it and before any substantial change in condition of the goods which is not caused by their own defects. It is not effective until the buyer notifies the seller of it.
> 
> (3) A buyer who so revokes has the same rights and duties with regard to the goods involved as if he had rejected them.

##### 2.3.4 Additional Remedies Upon Revocation or Rejection: UCC § 2-711

> § 2-711 Buyer's Remedies in General; Buyer's Security Interest in Rejected Goods.
> 
> (1) Where the seller fails to make delivery or repudiates or the buyer rightfully rejects or justifiably revokes acceptance then with respect to any goods involved, and with respect to the whole if the breach goes to the whole contract (Section 2-612), the buyer may cancel and whether or not he has done so may in addition to recovering so much of the price as has been paid
> 
> (a) “cover” and have damages under the next section as to all the goods affected whether or not they have been identified to the contract; or
> 
> (b) recover damages for non-delivery as provided in this Article (Section 2-713).
> 
> (2) Where the seller fails to deliver or repudiates the buyer may also
> 
> (a) if the goods have been identified recover them as provided in this Article (Section 2-502); or
> 
> (b) in a proper case obtain specific performance or replevy the goods as provided in this Article (Section 2-716).
> 
> (3) On rightful rejection or justifiable revocation of acceptance a buyer has a security interest in goods in his possession or control for any payments made on their price and any expenses reasonably incurred in their inspection, receipt, transportation, care and custody and may hold such goods and resell them in like manner as an aggrieved seller (Section 2-706).

### 3 Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act

#### 3.1 Statute & Regulations

##### 3.1.1 Statute: 15 USC §§ 2301 et seq.

##### 3.1.2 Regulations: 16 CFR §§ 700 et seq.

#### 3.2 Application

##### 3.2.1 Universal Motors v. Waldock (Alas. 1986)
- Facts
	- Warranty:
		- 3 years/36,000 miles
		- “free of defects in materials or workmanship”
	- Engine failed within warranty period
		- Manufacturer denied warranty coverage, claiming buyer misuse
- Issue
	- Burden of proof in a Magnuson Moss warranty claim
- Analysis
	- Magnuson Moss creates federal cause of action for breach of consumer warranties
	- Does not create any warranties
		- Must look to other law (i.e. state UCC) for source of warranties
		- Does not pre-empt state law warranty claims
	- Elements of Claim
		- Same elements as a state UCC warranty claim
		- Elements of an express “repair or replace” warranty claim:
			- Existence of a defect
			- Defect resulted from factory materials or workmanship
			- Consumer presented vehicle for repair
			- Seller failed or refused to repair
		- Consumer’s burden as to the second element
			- Need not conclusively establish the cause of the defect
				- Sufficient to 
					- Show that the vehicle did not work properly, and
					- Advance a plausible explanation 
	- Court relies on language of Magnuson Moss:
		- “The performance of the duties under subsection (a) … shall not be required of the warrantor if he can show that the defect ... was caused by damage (not resulting from defect or malfunction) while in the possession of the consumer, or unreasonable use (including failure to provide reasonable and necessary maintenance).” 15 USC § 2304(c) [emphasis added by Court]
		- “Once the consumer offers credible evidence that the defect is materials or workmanship related, the burden shifts to the warrantor to prove consumer abuse.”
	- But what evidence will satisfy the consumer’s burden?
		- In this case, plaintiff offered expert testimony that engine failure resulted from a damaged timing tensioner
	- Policy rationale
		- Ability to discover cause (and to alter evidence of cause) is within seller’s control

### 4 Consumer Product Safety Act

#### 4.1 Statute & Regulations

##### 4.1.1 Statute: 15 USC §§ 2051 et seq.
- Substantive provisions
	- Rulemaking by CPSC (§ 2056)
		- Performance requirements
		- Warning or instruction requirements
	- Certification and labeling (§ 2063)
	- Notice of defects (§ 2064)
	- Inspection and recordkeeping (§ 2065)
	- Private Suit for Damages (§ 2072)
- Elements of claim
	- Injury
		- Does this include economic injury?
			- See Monetary Remedies Under §  23 of Consumer Product Safety Act, 87 ALR Fed. 587 (1988)
			- *Griswold Insulation Co. v Lula Cotton Processing Co*. (1982, MD Tenn) 540 F Supp 1334 (§ 6)
			 - Insulation installer and wholesaler sued insulation manufacturer and consulting/marketing firm that represented manufacturer, seeking damages for economic loss from insulation that allegedly did not conform to minimum safety standards
			 - Defendants moved for summary judgment, arguing that the Act provides protection only in instances where bodily injury results and not for purely economic injuries like those alleged by the plaintiff. 
			 - Court denied defendants' motion for summary judgment
    			 - The court disagreed with the defendants' argument that the 15 U.S.C.A. § 2052(a)(3) definition of "risk of injury" defined the scope of any "injury" for which recovery might be sought under 15 U.S.C.A. § 2072 
    			 - "Risk of injury" as used in 15 U.S.C.A. § 2052(a)(3) was not coextensive with "injury" as used in 15 U.S.C.A. § 2072 and did not control the meaning of that term 
			     - If the definitions were so related, a consumer purchasing defective insulation could not recover if the defect caused his home to burn to the ground unless someone was injured. 
    			 - Congress could not have intended actual physical injury to be a prerequisite to recovery under the Act
	- Resulting from knowing (or willful) violation of a consumer product safety rule
	- Matter in controversy > $10,000
- Remedies
	- Actual damages
	- Costs & Attorney’s Fees
		- But if plaintiff recovers less than $10,000 court may deny costs to plaintiff, and may impose costs on plaintiff
- Private Enforcement (§ 2073)
	-  “Any interested person” may sue “to enforce a consumer product safety rule or an order under section 15”
	- Court may grant injunctive relief
	- Court may also award costs & attorneys’ fees
	- Private enforcement not available in there is a pending action by the US
	- Relationship to state law remedies (§ 2074)
		- Compliance with consumer product safety rules does not negate liability under state law
		- Evidence of Commission’s inaction not admissible in litigation under state law
	- Accident and investigation reports by the Commission are public information

##### 4.1.2 Regulations: 16 CFR §§ 1000 et seq. 

##### 4.1.3 Payne v. E.O. Smith
- Issue: Applicable statute of limitations
    - Goes to nature of action, and distinction between CPSA claim & personal injury claim

##### 4.1.4 Zepik v. Tidewater Midwest, Inc. (7th Cir. 1988)
- Issue
	- Whether § 23 (15 USC § 2072) authorizes private suit predicated on alleged violation of reporting requirements (16 CFR Part 1115)
- Holding
	- Private suit under §23 may not be predicated on alleged violation of reporting requirements
		- Reporting regulations are “interpretive” – i.e. merely restate the statutory provision
			- But § 23 only permits private suit based on violation of rules, not statute itself
			- Court doesn’t rely on this rationale, because neither the statutory text nor the legislative history supports a distinction between interpretive and legislative rules for purposes of § 23
	- Problem of attributing causation
		- In a § 23(a) suit, plaintiff must show that injury occurred “by reason of” the violation
		- Causal link between reporting violation and injury is too tenuous
