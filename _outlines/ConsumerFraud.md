Unfair & Deceptive Trade Practices
----------------------------------

### 1 Common Law Remedies

#### 1.1 Fraudulent Representation

##### 1.1.1 Elements of Fraud

-   False representation of material fact
    -   Representations taken as a whole
    -   Mere opinions or predictions won’t support a claim
-   Knowledge/belief that representation is false
    -   Or lack of sufficient basis for representation
-   Intention to induce action in reliance on representation
-   Justifiable reliance on representation
    -   i.e. Plaintiff enters into contract in reliance on misrepresentation
    -   Reasonableness: takes into account differences in experience or knowledge between the parties
-   Damage resulting from reliance

##### 1.1.2 Remedies for Fraud

-   Rescission
-   Damages
    -   Benefit of the bargain (i.e. expectation)
    -   Out-of-pocket (i.e. reliance)
-   UCC § 2-721
>Remedies for material misrepresentation or fraud include all remedies available under this Article for non-fraudulent breach.  Neither rescission or a claim for rescission of the contract for sale nor rejection or return of the goods shall bar or be deemed inconsistent with a claim for damages or other remedy.

##### 1.1.3 *Fischer v. Division West Chinchilla Ranch* (Minn. 1970)

-   What were the misrepresentations?
-   Why was plaintiffs’ reliance reasonable?
-   What was the remedy?
    -   What did the court exclude? Why?
        -   No compensation for lost time spent on the chinchillas
        -   No compensation for modifications to homes for the chinchillas

#### 1.2 Fraud by Omission

##### 1.2.1 Traditional Approach

-   Caveat emptor
    -   Seller had no affirmative duty to disclose
    -   Buyer has duty to inquire and examine

##### 1.2.2 Modern Approach

-   Trend toward some affirmative duty
    -   Based on conditions and seller’s conduct
-   Duty may arise from
    -   Latent defects not readily observable or discoverable
    -   Partial disclosure or representation by seller, creating misleading appearance

##### 1.2.3 *Von Hoffman v. Prudential Ins. Co.* (NY 2002)

-   What were the alleged misrepresentations?
    -   Which did the court find were sufficient to state a claim for fraud?
        -   Failure to disclose change in manner of crediting dividends
    -   Why were the others not sufficient?
-   Why didn’t the court give effect to the contractual disclaimers?
    -   Parol evidence rule does not apply to fraud claims
    -   Fraud is a tort claim, not a contract claim
    -   Contractual terms, including disclaimers of warranties, don’t apply
    -   The whole point is that the plaintiff only entered into the contract in the first place because of the defendant’s fraud
    -   The remedy seeks avoidance of the contract, so it wouldn’t make sense to hold plaintiff to its terms

#### 1.3 Pleading Fraud

###### FRCP Rule 9(b)

> Fraud or Mistake; Conditions of Mind. In alleging fraud or mistake, a party must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake. Malice, intent, knowledge, and other conditions of a person's mind may be alleged generally.

-   How much detail is required?

##### 1.3.2 *Carroll v. Fremont Investment & Loan* (D.D.C. 2009)

-   What were the misrepresentations here?
-   Shouldn’t plaintiffs have known that the lender has inflated their incomes & assets?
    -   Shouldn’t they themselves be culpable?
    -   Should “unclean hands” be a defense?

#### 1.4 Additional Remedies

##### 1.4.1 Punitive damages

-   May be allowed where defendant acted with
    -   Actual malice
    -   Reckless regard for consequences

##### 1.4.2 *Joyner v. Albert Merrill School* (Civil Ct. NYC 1978)

-   What is the policy basis for protecting the consumer here?
    -   Equal bargaining power
-   Why did the court not give effect to the contractual “merger clause”
    -   General merger clause is not enough to put plaintiff on notice of what has been disclaimed
    -   Giving effect to the clause would encourage & reward clever drafting
-   Why does the court find punitive damages appropriate here?
    -   What did defendant do to merit punitive damages?
    -   What is the purpose of punitive damages?
        -   Deterrence

##### 1.4.3 Attorney fees

-   May be provided by statute
-   May be provided for in contract
    -   But if the point of a fraud claim to to avoid the contract, should plaintiff be able to assert contractual right to fees?
        -   Contract is voidable at plaintiff’s option, but plaintiff can hold defendant to contract terms

##### 1.4.4 *Layman v. Binns* (Ohio 1988)

-   Requirements for caveat emptor:
    -   Defect is open to observation or discoverable upon reasonable inspection
    -   Buyer has unimpeded opportunity to examine
    -   Seller does not engage in fraud
-   Duty arises where:
    -   Seller knows fact materially affecting value of property
    -   Facts not readily observable, and not known to buyer

##### 1.4.5 *Stambovsky v. Ackley* (NY App. Div. 1991)

-   “Haunted House”
-   Remedy: Rescission & Recovery of Downpayment
    -   What is the injury to the plaintiff?
    -   What’s the remedy?
        -   Recission
        -   Why not damages?
-   Non-disclosure is basis for recession where:
    -   Condition created by seller
    -   Materially impair value of contract
    -   Peculiarly within knowledge of seller, or unlikely to be discovered
-   Partial disclosure may create duty of full disclosure

##### 1.4.6 *Ward Development Co. v. Ingrao* (Md. Ct. App. 1985)

-   Negligent Misrepresentation
    -   Negligent assertion of false statement of material fact
        -   By defendant owing a duty to plaintiff
    -   Intent that plaintiff rely on statement
    -   Knowledge of probable reliance
    -   Justifiable reliance by plaintiff
    -   Damages
-   Material Fact:
    -   Reasonable person would attach importance to it in deciding whether to enter into transaction, OR
    -   Defendant knows or has reason to know that the buyer is likely to regard it as important, even though a reasonable person would not
-   Promise v. Estimate
    -   Expertise or special knowledge on part of defendant may give rise to liability for representations as to future facts, and not merely existing facts

-   Focus: effect on consumers not intent of seller.
    -   Applies to both false & misleading (though true) representations

##### 2.1.2 FTC Policy Statement on Deception (1983)

-   Standard for “deception” under § 5:
    -   “likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably under the
        circumstances”

#### 4.1 “Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices”

##### 4.1.1 *Kugler v. Romain* (NJ 1971)

-   Facts
    -   Door-to-door sales of educational books
    -   Target consumers:
        -   “minority group consumers”
        -   “consumers of limited education and economic means”
-   NJ Statute
    -   “use .. of any deception, fraud, false pretense, false promise, misrepresentation … in connection with the sale … of any merchandise … whether or not any person has in fact been misled, deceived or damaged thereby”
    -   Is reliance an element?
        -   Statute identifies two sets of prohibited practices:
            -   “deception, fraud, false pretense, false, promise, [or] misrepresentation”
            -   “knowing concealment, suppression, or omission of any material fact with intent that others rely upon such concealment, suppression or omission”
        -   Express reliance element in second category suggests there is no reliance requirement under the first category
-   Analysis
    -   Why does the sales practice fall within the scope of prohibited conduct under the statute?
        -   Court relies on exorbitant price in relation to dubious value of goods
        -   Court interprets statute to cover “unconscionable” sales practices, even though the statute does not use the term
    -   Reference to “unconsionability” under UCC § 2-302
        -   “good faith, honesty in fact and observance of fair dealing”
    -   Court equates “unconsionability” with “deception, fraud, false preteens, misrepresentation, concealment and the like”
        -   Is that persuasive?
-   Remedy
    -   Attorney General may seek a remedy on behalf of all consumers
    -   “unconsionability renders the sales contract invalid as to all consumers”

#### 4.2 Scope of Protection

##### 4.2.1 *Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball Co.* (1893)

-   Who does/should the law protect?
    -   “Reasonable consumer”
    -   “Least sophisticated consumer”
        -   "It may be that, of the many readers of the advertisement, very few of the sensible ones would have entertained expectations that in the event of the smoke ball failing to act as a preventive against the disease, the defendant had any intention to fulfil their attractive and alluring promise; but it must be remembered that such advertisements do not appeal so much to the wise and thoughtful as to the credulous and weak portions of the community;"
    -   Should the unbelievable nature of the claim be a defense?
        -   “[I]f a person chooses to make extravagant promises of this kind he probably does so because it pays him to make them, and, if he has made them, the extravagance of the promises is no reason in law why he should not be bound by them”

#### 4.3 Reliance

##### 4.3.1 *Pelman v. McDonald’s Corp.* (2d Cir. 2005)

-   Reliance is not an element of a UDAP claim
    -   Why not?

#### 4.4 Remedies

##### 4.4.1 *Bennett v. Hayes* (Cal. App. 1975)

-   California Statute:
    -   “[R]epair dealer shall give to the customer a written estimated price for labor and parts necessary for a specific job”
    -   “[S]hall not charge for work done or parts supplied in excess of the estimated price without the oral or written consent of the customer”
-   Remedy
    -   May not charge for excess work
    -   Statute precludes recovery based on unjust enrichment
-   What’s the policy behind this remedy?
    -   What if the customer also engaged in fraud or deception?

##### 4.4.2 Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 7031

-   Unlicensed contractor may not “bring … any action, or recover in law or equity … for the collection of compensation for the performance of any act or contract”
    -   Prohibits claims for breach of contract and equitable alternatives (promissory estoppel, unjust enrichment)
-   Suppose Customer hires Contractor, knowing that Contractor is not licensed in California, and intending to stiff Contractor on payment.
    -   May Contractor sue for fraud? UDAP?
        -   *Hydrotech Systems, Ltd v. Oasis Waterpark* (Cal. 1991)
            -   Contractor may not assert claim for fraud, where “primary deceit alleged is false promise to pay”
            -   “[S]tatutory prohibition operates even where the person for whom the work was performed knew the contractor was unlicensed”
            -   “[U]nlicensed contractor may not circumvent the clear provisions and purposes of § 7031 simply by alleging that when the illegal contract was made, the other party had no intention of performing”
-   *Holland v. Morse Diesel Intern., Inc.* (Cal. App. 2001)
    -   § 7031 does not preclude unlicensed contractor from bringing suit under 42 USC § 1981 alleging racial discrimination in contract terms.
